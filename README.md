# Mips-assembly-functions

A mips assembly implementation of two programs:

1. The first is a fibonacci program that returns the n'th fibonacci number.
2. The second program has three functions. The program is getting a string. The first function calculates its lengh, the second function checks if the string is a palindrome or not using a loop, and the third function checks it using recursion.
